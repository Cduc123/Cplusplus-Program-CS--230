The Gaming Room, a client focused on developing a web-based version of their game *Draw It or Lose It*, required a scalable, distributed, and platform-independent solution. Their software needed to support multiple teams and players while ensuring real-time interaction, security, and cross-platform compatibility. The game also required efficient memory management and cloud-based hosting to optimize performance and scalability. To meet these needs, the design incorporated technologies like WebSockets for real-time communication, cloud infrastructure for hosting, and security mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 authentication.

In developing the documentation, I particularly excelled in structuring the software design to align with both business and technical requirements. Breaking down the system into components such as architecture, constraints, and recommendations ensured clarity and feasibility. Working through the design document was especially useful in defining the project scope before coding, allowing for a logical approach to problem-solving. If I were to revise one part, I would enhance the security section by detailing additional cybersecurity best practices, such as API rate limiting and penetration testing. Considering the userâ€™s needs from the outset was crucial to designing an intuitive and engaging gaming experience, reinforcing the importance of user-centric design in software development. For future projects, I would refine my approach by utilizing Agile methodologies to iteratively test and improve the software design before full-scale implementation.
